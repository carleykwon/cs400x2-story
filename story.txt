Richard: Here is where we started and we have a long way to go.
We write stories not to escape programming, but for programming not to escape from us.
This story is for all the stories in the future still yet to come.
We start here today and create more of our own stories.

Life on its own is just an individual story. It is a mere one story of 
trillions that have already ended, billions that are being written right now,
and God knows how many yet to come. And the interesting thing is that
all of them are closely intertvined and affect each other story in 
this book of humankind. 

This book of humankind is truely rich in history and culture. For every chapter is
a life of a human, each with their own story. The chapters of the book are intertuined 
with each other and can read is almost like a binary search tree. With the book being 
forever growing, with a new chapter being written everyday, and an old chapter coming 
to its end; we know that this books is forever infinite.

Love,
Nayun, Richard, Alex, Jamal
